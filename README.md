Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class projects

## Projects Included 

### N-Queens Solver
This project provides a Python implementation of a solver for the classic **N-Queens problem**, where `n` queens must be placed on an `n Ã— n` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Spam Filter

A system for spam filtering made by processing the raw training data, estimating the conditional probability distributions of the words in the vocabulary determined by each document class, then using a naive Bayes model to make predictions on the test set.

## Tile Puzzle Solver

This project implements a generalized sliding tile puzzle solver for boards of any size (rows x columns). The puzzle consists of numbered tiles and one empty space (represented by 0). The goal is to arrange the tiles in ascending order starting at the top-left corner and ending with the empty tile in the bottom-right corner, similar to the classic 8-puzzle.
